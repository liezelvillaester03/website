                        Hello! I'm Liezel, a Software Developer, currently residing in Baranggay Calumangan, Bago City.
                        I have 5 months of experience in Software Development Training Center (SDTP) at NOLITC, Bacolod City, specializing in web development.
                        My passion for learning programming drives me to pursue a career as a Web Developer.
                        Additionally, I have worked on a capstone project during my college, focusing on the development of a web-based system for the Bago City College Registrar's Office. This project involved creating an online appointment requisition system with email notification functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my professional work, I enjoy learning new things. I firmly believe that with dedication and hard work, anything is achievable.
                        I believe that what you want, you will get, as long as you're willing to work for it.
                    </p>
